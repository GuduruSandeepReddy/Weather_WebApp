# Weather App

## Project Overview

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to search for weather data for any location using an external weather API. The app displays current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and wind speed in an easy-to-understand user interface.

## Features

- **Search Box:** Users can input the city or location they want to view the weather for.
- **Weather Display:** Weather information is displayed for the searched city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** 
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - React.js
- **Styles:**
  - Custom CSS for styling the search box and info boxes:
    - `SearchBox.css` for centering the search input box【11†source】.
    - `WeatherApp.css` for the overall background and layout【12†source】.
    - `infoBox.css` for weather display layout【13†source】.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Enter the name of the city in the search box.
3. The weather information will be displayed for the entered city, including the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

## Customization

- **Background Image**: The background image can be changed by updating the URL in `WeatherApp.css`【12†source】.
- **Styling**: You can customize the look and feel of the app by modifying the CSS files (`SearchBox.css`, `infoBox.css`, and `WeatherApp.css`).

## External APIs

- The app uses an external weather API to fetch the latest weather data. You will need to sign up for an API key from a weather service like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Weather Details**: Add more detailed weather information such as forecast, hourly weather, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for incorrect city names or API call failures.
